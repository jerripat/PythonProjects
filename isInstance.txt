 
>>> x = 12
>>> isinstance(x, int)
True
>>> y = 12.0
>>> isinstance(y, float)
True
So:

>>> if isinstance(x, int):
        print('x is a int!')

x is a int!
In case of long integers, the above won't work. So you need to do:

>>> x = 12L
>>> import numbers
>>> isinstance(x, numbers.Integral)
True
>>> isinstance(x, int)
False
